# Purpose

This website is mainly used as a repo of things we got tired of searching for in pinned messages on Discord.
While the logos are the properties of their respective owners, all of the actual content of the website was made by Users of the Salesforce Discord channel.
Any Content that is available on the wiki is licenses under MPL 2.0 > Basically, do whatever you want, but give credit.


# Contributing

Please read our Contributing Guidelines for contribution.
They boil down to:
"Please don't overwrite anything and at least warn of what change you are doing on the `#general` channel of the discord server".


# Legal Stuff

We do not own Salesforce, the Salesforce Logo, the Aller typeface, the Discord Brand, the Discord Logo, or any other trademark we reference.
The only reason they are referenced is because we are a Salesforce-focused community, and we almost exclusively are based on Discord.
Please direct any copyright claims to the `#general` channel of the discord server.
