# Contributing to the Salesforce Exchange

First of all, thanks for wanting to contribute!
Second, there are two main projects at the moment:

- [This website](#salesforce-exchange-website)
- [All other projects in the Salesforce-Exchange Organization](#other-projects)

These do not respect the same principles regarding contribution, so please take the time to read through these (very short) guidelines :)


## Salesforce Exchange Website
[salesforce-exchange-website]: #salesforce-exchange-website

### Adding Pages

To add pages, simply create a fork, add what you want, post on the `#general` channel of the Discord Server, create a pull request and submit it.
Seriously, we're not that big yet that we need huge processes for this.
If you want it and can build it, go for it.

Please note that all commits should be squashed while merging the Pull.

### Editing Content

- Typos, clarificiations, general fixes

Create a fork, modify the content, submit a pull request.

- General Modifications

Before doing any sizable modifications to the site, please head over to `#meta` in the Discord server, tag @here, and have a discussion about what needs to be changed and how.

## Other Projects
[other-projects]: #other-projects

All contributions should follow the "fork and pull" model [described here][development-models].
Basically fork it, adapt it, pull it.

We don't all have the same names on Discord as on Github, so additional notification is complicated.
If you wish, you can tag @here on `#github` in the Discord server.
